Congress directed the Council to administer two different sources of RESTORE Act funding. The first is called the Council-Selected Restoration Component. These funds are used for ecosystem restoration across the Gulf. It is referred to as the Council-Selected Restoration Component because funding is approved by a vote among the Council members. The Council periodically approves Council-Selected Restoration Component funding for batches of projects and programs in what is called a Funded Priorities List (FPL). The Council occasionally amends these FPLs to add additional funding or otherwise modify previously-approved activities. These approvals are done by a Council vote, after the Council seeks public input. FPLs are developed through collaboration among the state and federal Council members.
