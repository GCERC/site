---

The Council periodically approves Council-Selected Restoration Component funding for batches of projects and programs in what is called a Funded Priorities List (FPL). The Council occasionally amends these FPLs to add additional funding or otherwise modify previously-approved activities. Below are links to the Councilâ€™s FPL 3, which was approved in two parts - FPL 3(a) and FPL 3(b). Links to amendments to FPL 3(a) and 3(b) are also provided below.
