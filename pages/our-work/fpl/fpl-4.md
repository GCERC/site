## Draft 2026 Funded Priorities List

The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council or Council) proposes to commit approximately $403,654,000 in new funding for water quality improvement, habitat conservation and restoration, and other ecosystem projects and programs across the Gulf Coast, pursuant to the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies Act of the Gulf Coast States of 2012 (33 U.S.C. § 1321(t) and note) (RESTORE Act). This 2026 Funded Priorities List (FPL) proposal includes 19 ecosystem restoration projects and programs which build upon over $685 million in restoration activities previously identified by the Council. With these additional funds, the RESTORE Council will have committed over $1 Billion for restoration activities across the Gulf Coast under the Council-Selected Restoration Component of the RESTORE Act. In addition, the RESTORE Council proposes to reallocate $9,605,860 in savings from previously approved projects and programs to further support activities in this draft FPL. This draft 2026 FPL proposal also includes updates to the RESTORE 2022 Comprehensive Plan. Members of the public are invited to provide comments on this proposal. 

More detail on the proposed 2026 FPL activities is provided in the table below, along with links to associated documents, including best available science reviews and environmental compliance documentation, where applicable. For projects marked as N/A, the best available science reviews can be found in the 2026 FPL Proposal Package.
