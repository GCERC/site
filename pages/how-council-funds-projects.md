The Council is guided by a Comprehensive Plan, which establishes our vision, goals, and objectives for Gulf ecosystem restoration. Projects and programs funded by the Council must align with the Comprehensive Plan goals and objectives. The Comprehensive Plan also has Council commitments to science, collaboration, public engagement and more. The Council’s vision is:

“A healthy and productive Gulf ecosystem achieved through collaboration on strategic restoration projects and programs.”
