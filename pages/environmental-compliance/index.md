This page provides information regarding Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (Council) compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other environmental requirements for Funded Priorities Lists (FPLs).

## Efficient, Effective and Transparent Environmental Compliance 

As with all federal agencies, the Council must comply with all applicable federal environmental laws, regulations and executive orders.  Compliance avoids unintended adverse impacts, informs funding decisions and provides public engagement opportunities. The Council is committed to efficient, effective and transparent environmental compliance. 

## NEPA Procedures

The Council’s [NEPA procedures](/uploads/EC/GCERC_NEPA_Procedures_May_2015.pdf) establish the Council's policies for ensuring compliance with NEPA.
