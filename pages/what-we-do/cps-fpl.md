The RESTORE Council periodically approves Council-Selected Restoration Component funding for batches of projects and programs in what is called a Funded Priorities List (FPL). The Council occasionally amends these FPLs to add additional funding or otherwise modify previously-approved activities. Below are links to the Councilâ€™s Comprehensive Plan Commitment and Planning Support FPL, along with links to the amendments to this FPL. Unlike traditional FPLs, the CPS FPL provides funding needed by Council members to conduct the planning and collaboration needed to develop FPL proposals.
