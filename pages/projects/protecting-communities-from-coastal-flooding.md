Coastal flooding is a major concern for communities across the Gulf Coast. The Council helps protect coastal communities by investing in flood risk reduction infrastructure including the Houma Navigation Canal Lock and the Paradis Canal Floodgate. Additionally, the Council’s ecosystem restoration projects can provide added resilience for communities by restoring wetlands and other ecosystems that provide natural flood protection. For example, the Council recently approved construction funding for the Pensacola Bay Living Shoreline project, which among other benefits will provide nature-based resilience for the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
