## Privacy policy

The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council does not collect any personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information. The only information that the Council automatically collects is each website visitor’s Internet domain and IP address, the type of browser and operating system used to access the site, the pages visited and time spent on each page, and the date and time of the visit. If you send an email to the Council through this website, the personal information you provide will be used only to respond to your message. We will not disclose or share this personal information outside of the Council without your explicit permission.

The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a, passed by Congress in 1974, establishes certain controls over what personal information is collected by the federal government and how it is used. The act guarantees three primary rights: (1) the right to see records about oneself, subject to the Privacy Act's exemptions; (2) the right to amend that record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or incomplete; and (3) the right to sue the government for violations of the statute, including permitting others to see your records, unless specifically permitted by the act.
