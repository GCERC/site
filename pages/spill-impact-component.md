## Spill Impact Component

Congress directed the Council to administer two different sources of RESTORE Act funding. The second is called the Spill Impact Component. These funds are used for ecosystem restoration and economic recovery in the Gulf states. It is referred to as the Spill Impact Component because funding is allocated to the Gulf states based on the effect of the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill in each state. The states are responsible for choosing which projects and programs to fund, subject to approval by the Council chair.

Spill Impact Component funding is allocated to the Gulf states based on the effect of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in each state. The Council approves these funds in state-specific batches of projects and programs called State Expenditure Plans (SEPs). The Council occasionally amends SEPs to add more activities or modify previously-approved projects and programs.

Below are the total amounts allocated to each state along with links to the SEPs for each state:

Alabama (/spill-impact-component/alabama) - $327,043,127

Florida (/spill-impact-component/florida) - $294,338,815

Louisiana (/spill-impact-component/louisiana) - $554,530,479

Mississippi (/spill-impact-component/mississippi) - $305,721,198

Texas (/spill-impact-component/texas) - $121,518,966
