GOLIAD COUNTY - As he drives down a bumpy dirt road, T. Michael O'Connor describes everything he passes: the species of trees, the doves flying overhead, the feral hog that runs across the road in the distance. 

In a clearing near the San Antonio River, he makes eye contact with a deer watching his every move. On a hill a short drive away, he points out entrances to badgers' dens. 

O'Connor, 70, inherited this land, but his family members always taught him that it wasn't just his. 

They were conservationists before that was a well-known term, he said, and they impressed on their descendants the importance of leaving the land better than they received it.

Their message was "this is for the next generation," he said. "You take it as is, but you work hard to make it better." 

While Texas is changing rapidly, O'Connor recently guaranteed that this land won't, agreeing to a conservation easement that prevents the property from ever being divided or developed. 

The easement covers 6,600 acres in Goliad County, about 90 miles southeast of San Antonio. 

The easement is an agreement with a nonprofit, the Nature Conservancy, and was paid for mostly with federal funds from penalties paid as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

O'Connor will continue using the ranch land, but the permanent easement ensures that this coastal prairie land - a rapidly shrinking habitat - will remain intact. 

"This ranch is a unique ecosystem," O'Connor said. "We're very determined to keep those prairie lands as prairie lands" 

'One of their last strongholds' 

O'Connor - who is the current U.S. Marshal of the Southern District of Texas and former Victoria County sheriff - is a fifth-generation rancher. (He's also the fifth Thomas, though he goes by T. Michael.) 

The first Thomas Michael O'Connor came to Refugio from Ireland in the 1830s and began buying what became more than a half million acres of ranchland owned by the family. That property is now 300,000 acres, split across eight divisions in Texas and New Mexico. It has been divided among the family's heirs. 

The landscape might not be as striking as the hills and rivers of the Texas Hill Country, or the mountains and deserts of West Texas - but it's a vitally important ecosystem.

In Texas, the coastal prairies stretch from Louisiana to Brownsville and are known for the bays, marshes, grasses and wildlife that call them home, especially birds. 

"Houston was all a coastal prairie at one time. And you know, now we've got Houston," said Jeff Francell, associate director of land protection for The Nature Conservancy in Texas. 

The prairie plays multiple roles. It acts as a buffer from floods and hurricanes, helps filter air and water, stores carbon and hosts wildlife, including the endangered Attwater's prairie chicken and the threatened black rail, both bird species. 

"Coastal prairies are one of the rarest habitat types in the state," Francell said. "The species that depend on them. This is one of their last strongholds in the state. 

The O'Connor Ranch is a relatively intact tract of land and "fairly pristine," he said, making it a good candidate for conservation. 

The property's frontage on the San Antonio River added value, he said. The river winds from central San Antonio east toward the Gulf, where it meets the Guadalupe River and enters into San Antonio Bay, and the riparian area on its banks is also important for wildlife habitat and water quality. 

Preserving the ecological value 

O'Connor knows exactly how ecologically valuable the land is. 

After graduating from Texas A&M University in 1977, he worked with one of his botany professors on an analysis of all the vegetation on the O'Connor family lands. 

Every species found was sampled and documented, along with its frequency and geographic distribution on the property. O'Connor keeps that information in volumes of bound books, stored in the old cowboys' quarters on the Goliad ranch. 

His family always taught that caring for the land and water were key to ranching success. 

"We've been fortunate that each generation has contributed to the land, with the same emphasis: If you don't have the water and you don't have the land, you're not in the ranching business," he said. If those aren't healthy, "the animal aspect is a non-issue," he said.

He said keeping the brush under control and the invasive species out is a constant battle - one he's been working on for years with Kirk Feuerbacher, The Nature Conservancy's Working Lands Project director. 

The organization's Refugio-Goliad Prairie Project works to protect the remaining prairie lands, partnering with private landowners on strategies to keep the habitat intact. That includes using prescribed burns and developing grazing plans that are balanced with habitat management.

Part of the work is trying to make it profitable and sustainable for the lands to remain in their native prairie state. 

"Generational succession is tough," Feuerbacher said. As land is passed through families, the owners have increasing financial incentives to sell it for industrial growth, housing and other land conversion. 

There's also a lot of interest in wind and solar farms in the area, Francell said, another incentive for owners to develop their coastal prairie lands. 

"We recognize that those are important," he said, but so is keeping the prairie intact. "It's just that, in our opinion, the ecological value of one of the last coastal prairies in the state takes primacy."

How easements work 

While easements don't change the ownership of the land, they're expensive because they limit the development potential and sale price in perpetuity. 

The holder of the easement - such as The Nature Conservancy, or other nonprofit or government entities elsewhere - pays the landowner in exchange for the restrictions on the property, which stay with the land even if it's sold to someone else. 

The O'Connor easement cost just under $8.8 million. In exchange for that payment, the conservancy now has the right to monitor the land and enforce the rules of the agreement. If those aren't followed, the organization can require remediation, or take the owner to court for enforcement.

About $7.6 million for the easement came from the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, known as the RESTORE Council. 

The council, which has representatives from six federal agencies and the five Gulf Coast states, administers money from civil penalties related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, which spilled more than 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf and became the largest marine oil spill in history. 

The money is used to support ecological restoration, economic development, coastal protection and community resilience projects across the Gulf, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which represents the state on the council. 

The easement on the O'Connor Ranch is the first conservation easement approved by the council, and "the largest land protection deal in the Gulf that the RESTORE act has funded," TCEQ said in a written statement. 

"The RESTORE Council is very pleased to support the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality's and The Nature Conservancy's efforts to protect critical coastal prairie habitat on Texas family ranchlands," council Executive Director Mary Walker said in a written statement. "Conservation of such valuable natural habitat is a key strategy to support ecosystem health, and effective partnerships such as this one are essential to Gulf restoration success. We commend TCEQ and TNC for this meaningful effort to advance Gulf Coast restoration and maintain the productivity of these important agricultural lands.”

Private donors made up the rest of the easement's cost, Francell said. The Knobloch Family Foundation, Frank Klein and H-E-B all contributed. 

'We can coexist' 

O'Connor said the decision to pursue the conservation easement came after years of consideration and discussion. 

His father and grandparents "may be rolling in their graves for what I did," he said, referring to bringing in an outside entity that has some control over what happens on the ranch.

But they wanted him to continue ranching and for the land to remain a ranch, he said - so he sees the agreement as ensuring that continues, even if it's in a way they didn't imagine. 

"With all this in mind, what is the best relationship outside the family?" he asked. He landed on the conservation easement, deciding it was "a win-win situation," and said when he explained it to his children, "they were all for it." 

O'Connor said the current easement is "the beginning," and more conservation efforts could follow. 

He said he wants to see more research and education happening on the property. He has plans to fix up some cabins and other buildings on the ranch to house students and researchers, and a comprehensive management plan for the ranch, which is part of the easement agreement, includes working with Texas A&M's Center for Grazinglands and Ranch Management on monitoring and guidance to support the prairie. 

Even though the ranch remains private land, the public should recognize the importance of conserving it, sad Francell, of The Nature Conservancy. 

"There's always the canary in the coal mine," he said. "A healthy, functioning landscape should have the species that are meant to be there, and if one starts to go, then they could have a cascading effect." 

"It also kind of gets to your values as Texans," he said. "We developed a whole lot of the state and it's changed quite a bit since I was born. It's kind of nice to know that there are places that are going to be the same going forward and not change." 

He said The Nature Conservancy hopes to protect more land in the Refugio-Goliad area, and that O'Connor's decision could inspire others to do the same. 

O'Connor agrees, and hopes other South Texas ranching families follow suit. 

"We can be the leaders," he said, modeling that ranchers and conservationists aren't inherently at odds. "Maybe we can show them there is harmony and we can coexist."
