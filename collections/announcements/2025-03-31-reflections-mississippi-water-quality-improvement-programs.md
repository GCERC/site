## Reflections on Restoration Progress

_RESTORE Council- 2025_

### **Mississippi Water Quality Improvement Programs**

Clean water is essential for healthy and prosperous Gulf communities. The RESTORE Council is making significant investments aimed at improving water quality across the Gulf coast. For example, the State of Mississippi, through the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), is implementing large-scale water quality improvement programs, utilizing $29.1 million in RESTORE funding from both the Council-Selected Restoration and the Spill Impact Components. Program activities include completing planning and construction projects to implement septic-to-sewer conversions, new stormwater and wastewater systems, and repairs/upgrades to existing stormwater and wastewater systems.

_The RESTORE Council invests in water quality improvements, reducing the pollution entering the waters of the Gulf Coast._

Water quality degradation in Mississippi coastal waters is caused by elevated bacteria, nutrient pollution, and associated hypoxia often attributed to urban runoff, discharge, and overflow issues associated with aging infrastructure or insufficient wastewater management. The conversion of septic-to-sewer and implementation of stormwater and wastewater improvements under this program will reduce pollutant loads to downstream coastal water bodies, resulting in water quality and fishery habitats improvements, improved conditions for water recreation activities along the coast, and benefits to the economy of the Mississippi Gulf Coast region. A total of 11 projects are currently underway.
