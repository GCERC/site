## Reflections on Restoration Progress

_RESTORE Council- 2025_

### **Three Mile Creek Watershed Restoration Project**

Water quality supports recreational and commercial fisheries and tourism; without it, coastal ecosystems are degraded, along with the environmental and economic benefits these ecosystems provide. The RESTORE Council has funded meaningful investments in water quality in all five Gulf states. In one such project, the state of Alabama, through the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR), was awarded $23.9 million in RESTORE Act Spill Impact Component funds for the Three Mile Creek Watershed Restoration project. Managed by ADCNR, the goal of this project is the restoration and protection of water quality of the Gulf Coast region’s fresh, estuarine, and marine water resources by providing streambank stabilization along Twelve Mile Creek and dredging and restoring Langan Park Lake. Twelve Mile Creek and Langan Park Lake both drain into Three Mile Creek and Mobile Bay.

The project leverages habitat restoration work conducted by the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program, which expands watershed-scale restoration for Three Mile Creek. The coordinated restoration of the creek between the two projects will improve water quality of the creek and lake, providing a healthier natural environment for wildlife and improved recreational opportunities and ultimately reducing pollution in Mobile Bay.

*The RESTORE Council is commemorating 15 years since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill  incident with a month-long reflection on its progress to date implementing meaningful ecosystem and economic restoration across the Gulf Coast.* [_Subscribe to our eBlast_](https://www.restorethegulf.gov/apps/eblast/Subscribe.aspx) *or* [_Modify your eBlast subscription._](https://www.restorethegulf.gov/apps/eblast/ModifyInformation.aspx)
