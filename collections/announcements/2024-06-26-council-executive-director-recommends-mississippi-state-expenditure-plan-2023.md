On May 23, 2024 the Council’s Executive Director provided a recommendation memo to the Council Chair, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to approve the Mississippi State Expenditure Plan 2023 Amendment. States amend SEPs to increase funding for projects or programs in existing SEPs and/or add new activities to the SEP. States submit SEP amendments for approval by the Council Chair. This SEP Amendment, if approved, would increase funding for existing SEP activities including restoration planning, a working waterfront in support of commercial seafood, and a coastal science program for high schools. The amendment would also provide funding for new activities including invasive species detection and treatment, a Pascagoula River scenic trail, an artificial reef project, an interactive aquarium exhibit, and educational facilities at a Center for Marine Education and Research. The total funding that would be approved for both the new and existing SEP activities is $17,100,000.
