## Reflections on Restoration Progress

_RESTORE Council- 2025_

### **Protecting and restoring valuable coastal habitat**

From Texas to Florida, the Council is acquiring valuable coastal habitat and protecting it in perpetuity to ensure it is available for use and enjoyment by future generations. The Council also invests in restoring habitat across the Gulf, including wetlands, cypress swamp, barrier islands, and oyster beds. These habitats provide a wide array of benefits, from improving water quality and reducing flooding to supporting tourism and other economic uses. Below are a few examples of our work across the Gulf Coast.

_The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was awarded RESTORE funds for the Robinson Preserve Wetlands Restoration project. This project will provide approximately 58 acres of coastal upland habitat and approximately 60 acres of wetland, open water sub-tidal, and open freshwater habitats, for a total of approximately 118 acres of restored productive habitat within the Robinson Preserve in Manatee County, FL._

_RESTORE funds provided approximately 1,998 acres of land to be added to a 105,000-acre corridor of conservation lands that includes the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Boca Chica State Park and the Lower Rio Grande Valley NWR. This corridor also connects over 2 million acres of private ranchland located north of Laguna Atascosa NWR with the 1.3 million acres in the Rio Bravo Protected Area in Mexico._
