**ATLANTA** (April 17, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional Administrator Kevin McOmber, leadership from the Florida Department of Protection, Escambia County, Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council) Executive Director Mary Walker, and senior advisors visited restoration projects along the Gulf Coast to mark the 15th anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and learn about ongoing efforts to restore the impacted coastal areas.

One such restoration project is the Pensacola Bay Living Shoreline Project, a large-scale project funded by the RESTORE Council, the U.S. Department of Defense, the State of Florida, and the National Fish and Wildlife Federation, to address erosion and habitat loss across three sites near the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. 

“We are pleased to be part of the efforts to restore areas along the Gulf of America Coast, an area that not only serves as a recreational resource but also an economic driver for the area,” **said EPA Regional Administrator Kevin McOmber.** “We are grateful for this opportunity to see firsthand the important efforts of the RESTORE Council, Escambia County, and Florida Department of Environmental Protection to restore this vital coastline.” 

“We are excited to be part of the work that is taking place here in Escambia County and in communities across the Gulf Coast to restore and protect the region’s beautiful natural resources. The Pensacola Living Shoreline project is an excellent example of the priority that RESTORE Council members place on maximizing the benefits of investments by working collaboratively and leveraging funds with other restoration partners,” **said Mary Walker, RESTORE Council Executive Director.** “Through partnership and collaboration, we are making significant strides in restoring the Gulf Coast’s invaluable ecosystems, ensuring that the region will be resilient and vibrant for future generations."

EPA, in coordination with federal, state and local partners, will continue to provide a wide range of expertise in water quality, marine debris, wetland restoration, and non-point source nutrient reduction to support the Deepwater Horizon Planning efforts and long-term restoration projects.

**Background**

The Pensacola Bay Living Shoreline Project  
The Pensacola Bay Living Shorelines Project seeks to reverse damage and restore the coastal area by using nature-based measures to prevent erosion and flooding. It will use sediment, marsh plants, and breakwaters to beef up a coastline rather than concrete or metal structures, and these natural measures can double as habitats for fish, oysters, sea turtles, birds, and other native wildlife.
