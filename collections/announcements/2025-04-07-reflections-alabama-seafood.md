## Reflections on Restoration Progress

_RESTORE Council- 2025_

### **Alabama Seafood**

The RESTORE Council’s investments support the economies of Gulf states by providing jobs, promoting seafood and tourism, and restoring and protecting natural resources at the foundation of a strong Gulf economy. The RESTORE Council also supports local economies through seafood promotion and tourism projects such as boat ramps, artificial reefs, and improvements to state and federal parks. Across the Gulf, the RESTORE Council’s investments provide jobs for planners, engineers, construction workers, scientists, and others working to protect and restore the coastal environment.

The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) received $2.9M for the Eat Alabama Seafood program which was started to clear the stigma that had become associated with seafood from the Gulf after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
