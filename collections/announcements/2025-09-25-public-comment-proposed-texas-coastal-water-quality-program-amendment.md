The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (Council) is seeking public comment on proposals for multiple ecosystem restoration activities located in Texas under its [2021 Funded Priorities List 3b (FPL 3b)]({{ '../our-work/fpl/fpl-3.md' | inputPathToUrl }}). Specifically, the Council is planning to vote on whether to approve the following:

Proposed FPL 3b Amendment for the [Texas Coastal Water Quality Program](/uploads/FPL3b_TX_Coastal_Water_Quality_Program_ProposalPackage_20200717.pdf):

- $266,931 in planning funds to complete necessary water quality planning components (originally budgeted for water quality program implementation).

- $1,000,000 in implementation funding for the Improving Baffin Bay Water Quality project (originally budgeted for water quality program implementation).

Proposed Reallocation of Unspent [Initial FPL]({{ '../our-work/fpl/inital-funded-priorities-list.md' | inputPathToUrl }}) funds to FPL3b [Texas Chenier Plain Ecosystem Restoration Program](/uploads/FPL3b_TX_Chenier_Plain_Ecosystem_Restoration_Program_ProposalPackage_20200717.pdf):

This proposed reallocation would utilize a total of $1,446,270.17 in savings from the Initial FPL that was originally approved for Texas projects (the Matagorda Bay System Priority Landscape Conservation, Bayou Greenways, Bahia Grande Coastal Corridor, and Texas Beneficial Use/Marsh Restoration projects). These Initial FPL projects were completed under budget, and the savings is proposed to be reallocated to the FPL 3b Texas Chenier Plain Ecosystem Restoration Program.

- Reallocation of $1,000,000 in previously-approved Initial FPL funding to the previously-approved FPL 3b McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge Shoreline Breakwater project for implementation.

- Reallocation of $446,270.17 in previously-approved Initial FPL funding to the previously-approved FPL 3b J.D. Murphree Wildlife Management Area Levee project for implementation.

These proposed funding approvals are independent of each other; the Council may vote to approve all of the proposed amendments listed above, a subset of them, or none. Background on these proposed approvals is provided below. Before voting on whether to approve funding, the Council is publishing these proposed FPL amendments for a 30-day public comment period beginning on September 25, 2025 and concluding at 11:59 pm (CST) on October 27, 2025\.
