These meetings will highlight the activities proposed for funding in each geographic region of the coast and offer the public an opportunity to learn more about the projects and programs under consideration. Attendees will also have the option to provide verbal comment on the draft proposal during meetings.

“The extraordinary natural resources of the Gulf Coast region form the basis of our coastal communities, economies, and way of life. We invite all Gulf Coast stakeholders to participate in these meetings,” said Mary Walker, Executive Director of the RESTORE Council. “Public input is important to shaping investments that support long-term restoration and resilience across the region.”

We look forward to your participation and your comments on the draft FPL.
