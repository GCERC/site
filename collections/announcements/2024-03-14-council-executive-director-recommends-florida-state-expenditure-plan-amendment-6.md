On March 12, 2024 the Council’s Executive Director provided a recommendation memo to the Council Chair, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to approve the Florida State Expenditure Plan Amendment #6. States amend SEPs to increase funding for projects or programs in existing SEPs and/or add new activities to the SEP. States submit SEP amendments for approval by the Council Chair. The Florida SEP amendment, if approved, would modify scopes and/or reallocate funds among a subset of previously-approved projects to adjust to cost increases, changing priorities, and other factors. The amendment would also add a new project in Charlotte County to improve wastewater treatment capacity, replacing the County’s previously planned septic-sewer project.
