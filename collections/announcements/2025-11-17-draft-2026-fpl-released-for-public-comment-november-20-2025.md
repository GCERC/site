(New Orleans, LA) Today, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE Council) is releasing the draft of its  fourth Funded Priorities List (FPL),  which includes over $403 Million in proposed funding for water quality improvement, habitat conservation and restoration, and other ecosystem projects and programs across the Gulf Coast.  This draft 2026 FPL includes 19 ecosystem restoration projects and programs which would build upon over $685 million in restoration activities previously funded by the RESTORE Council. The Council will initiate a public comment period on the proposed slate of activities on November 20, 2025.

The activities proposed for funding would provide significant benefits to the Gulf Coast, including: 

* Ecosystem restoration in important ecoregions and watersheds, including the Texas Gulf Region, Lower Mississippi/Lake Pontchartrain watershed in Louisiana, Mississippi Sound in Mississippi and Alabama, the Mobile Bay and Mobile/Tensaw Delta Watershed in Alabama, and Pensacola Bay and other coastal watersheds in Florida. 
* Large-scale restoration of the Chandeleur Islands in Louisiana, which provide valuable habitat for a wide range of fish and wildlife species, while also serving as a first line of storm defense for coastal communities. 
* Leveraging funding from multiple sources, including previous FPLs, within specific geographic areas to maximize ecosystem restoration outcomes. 
* Restoration of a former barrier headland, a cross-state collaboration project led by Mississippi and Alabama. 
* Large-scale programs to address water quality and quantity, habitat restoration, coastal resilience and other ecosystem restoration needs in the Gulf Coast region. 
* Continuation of funding to enhance the environmental vitality of the region's natural resources while also providing environmental job training for youth from federally recognized Tribes. 
* Private land conservation and ecological restoration on agricultural lands across the Gulf; and 
* Scientific efforts to help build the knowledge needed to advance Gulf restoration. 

“As Chair of the RESTORE Council, I recognize that the Gulf of America is a vital natural resource and economic asset that plays a crucial role in supporting our nation’s economy. I commend the Gulf of America states for their leadership in the federal-state collaboration that produced this impressive array of proposed coastal investments totaling more than $403 Million,” said **David Fotouhi, Deputy**

**Administrator of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Chair of the RESTORE Council.** “This initiative underscores our commitment to cooperative federalism and cross-agency partnership in support of clean air, land, and water for every American.”

“This Gulf-wide investment will continue to provide coastal restoration to key ecosystems to improve water quality, habitat restoration and coastal resiliency,” said **Steven Schar, Deputy Executive Director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and RESTORE Council Co-Chair.** “I want to thank my fellow Council members and stakeholders for their efforts to help secure a better future for the Gulf Coast states.”

“I am very excited to share the projects included in the 2026 FPL and I look forward to the public feedback,” said **Chris Blankenship, Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources**. “There was a great deal of collaboration between the five states and six federal agencies to agree on this slate of projects. I am thankful for the good work of all the members of the RESTORE Council and Council staff during this long but productive process.”

"I join my colleagues across the Gulf of America in strong support of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council’s draft 2026 Funded Priorities List. The *Deepwater Horizon* disaster impacted not only Florida’s waters but also the families and communities that call our Gulf Coast home. Florida is taking bold steps to protect this remarkable region for generations to come through strategic initiatives focused on improving water quality, restoring hydrologic flow and enhancing coastal resilience." **– Adam Blalock, Deputy Secretary of Ecosystems Restoration, Florida Department of Environmental Protection**

“We are grateful to the state and federal RESTORE Council members and staff for their hard work and commitment in moving this funding plan forward,” said  **Michael Hare, Executive Director of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority**. “The inclusion of the Chandeleur Islands Restoration Project in the draft 2026 FPL is a critical step toward advancing one of Louisiana’s highest restoration priorities. Restoring the Chandeleurs will not only protect vital habitat for fish and wildlife but also strengthen our coast’s first line of defense against hurricanes and storms.”

“Mississippi is proud to continue working with our Gulf Coast partners to advance restoration projects that improve water quality, protect critical habitats, and strengthen the resilience of our coastal communities. This most recent draft FPL reflects a thoughtful, collaborative approach that builds on past progress while ensuring long-term benefits for our environment and economy.” – **Chris Wells, Executive Director of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.**

**Public Comment Period**

The draft 2026 FPL will be available for a public review and comment period beginning November 20, 2025 and ending at 11:59 pm MT on January 2, 2026. The Council will provide overview webinars on November 20, 2025  at 1:00 pm and 6:00 pm CT. In addition, a series of geographically focused public meetings and webinars will be scheduled  during the comment period. Members of the public are invited to visit [www.restorethegulf.gov](www.restorethegulf.gov) to register to attend these webinars and provide comments on the proposed FPL.  The Council will consider all comments received as it proceeds to finalize the 2026 FPL. The Council plans to vote on whether to approve this FPL in 2026.

**Background**

The RESTORE Council was established in 2012 by the *[Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-112publ141/pdf/PLAW-112publ141.pdf)* (RESTORE Act), a federal law enacted in response to the *Deepwater Horizon* disaster. The RESTORE Council consists of the governors of five Gulf Coast states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and the heads of six federal agencies (the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Department of the Interior, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). 

The RESTORE Act dedicated a portion of a civil settlement with parties responsible for the *Deepwater Horizon* disaster to the RESTORE Council to fund environmental and economic restoration across the Gulf Coast. The RESTORE Council oversees administration of two of the five components established by the RESTORE Act, representing 60% of the funds made available from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund established in the wake of the oil spill. Under the 2016 *Deepwater Horizon* [consent decree](https://www.justice.gov/enrd/file/838066/download) among the United States, the five Gulf States, and British Petroleum (BP), BP makes payments into the Trust Fund over a 15-year period ending in 2031. 

As funds become available, the RESTORE Council works collaboratively with input from stakeholders across the Gulf to develop Funded Priorities Lists (FPLs), which designate ecosystem projects and programs for funding.  The funding for FPLs comes from the RESTORE Act allocation known as the Council-Selected Restoration Component. 

In addition, the RESTORE Council oversees funding for State-led restoration and recovery efforts provided in State Expenditure Plans (SEPs) developed under the RESTORE Act.
