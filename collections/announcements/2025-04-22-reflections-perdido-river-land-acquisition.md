## Reflections on Restoration Progress

## _RESTORE Council- 2025_

### Perdido River Land Acquisition

The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) received $26.8 million in Council-Selected Restoration Component funding for the Perdido River Land Conservation and Habitat Enhancements program. The Perdido Watershed plays a critical role in the health of the ecosystem of Southeast Alabama and Northwest Florida. This program will increase the current acreage of property in public ownership in the Alabama portion of the watershed from approximately 17,000 acres, to over 28,000 acres, enhancing habitat connectivity and contributing greatly to the restoration and protection of native species and habitats, such as floodplain forests, hydric pine forests, longleaf pine forests, and freshwater wetlands.

Two acquisitions totaling over 3,000 acres, collectively known as the Magnolia South tracts, have already been acquired. These acquisitions are adjacent to existing conservation lands in public ownership in the Perdido Watershed, including the Perdido Wildlife Management Area, and have extensive frontage along the Perdido River. ADCNR will conduct habitat management and stewardship activities, which could include prescribed burning, invasive species removal, longleaf pine restoration, and protection and habitat enhancements for species including the gopher tortoise on the acquired property. The land will become part of the Perdido Wildlife Management Area and be accessible to the public for recreational use.

ADCNR will continue to look for opportunities for additional purchases with similar connectivity benefits with public lands within this unique watershed that straddles the border between Alabama and Florida.
